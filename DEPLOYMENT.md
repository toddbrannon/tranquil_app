# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

✅ **Build Process**
- [x] Production build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [x] Static assets generated in `dist/public/`
- [x] Server bundle created in `dist/index.js`

✅ **Health Check**
- [x] Health endpoint responds at `/health`
- [x] Returns JSON with status and timestamp
- [x] Accessible in production mode

✅ **Configuration Files**
- [x] `render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- [x] `Dockerfile` - Container deployment option
- [x] `.dockerignore` - Optimized container builds
- [x] `package.json` - Correct scripts for build/start

✅ **Environment Variables**
- [x] `NODE_ENV=production` configured
- [x] `PORT` environment variable support
- [x] Fallback to port 5000 for development

✅ **Static File Serving**
- [x] Production mode serves from `dist/public/`
- [x] SPA routing fallback to `index.html`
- [x] Asset paths correctly resolved

## Render Deployment Steps

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Push code to GitHub repository
   - Ensure all files are committed

2. **Render Service Creation**
   - Create new Web Service on Render.com
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Render auto-detects `render.yaml`

3. **Automatic Configuration**
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start: `npm start`
   - Health Check: `/health`
   - Environment: Node.js (Free tier)

4. **Deployment URL**
   - Will be available at: `https://tranquil-app.onrender.com`
   - Or custom domain if configured

## Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] App loads successfully
- [ ] All exercises work correctly
- [ ] Progress tracking functions
- [ ] Favorites system persists
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Health check responds

## Troubleshooting

**Build Failures:**
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Runtime Issues:**
- Check server logs in Render dashboard
- Verify health check endpoint
- Ensure static files are being served

**Performance:**
- Monitor response times
- Check bundle sizes in build output
- Verify asset optimization
